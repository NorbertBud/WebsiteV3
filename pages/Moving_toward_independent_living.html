            <p>  Your social worker or Personal Advisor can offer advice and support you in finding the right place. There are several options you can consider. <br>Foster Care:<br>Supported Lodgings:<br>Supported Accommodation:<br>Private Rented Flats or bed-sits:<br>Emergency Accommodation:<br>Accommodation while you are in Further Education:<br></p>

            <p> <strong> Budgeting:<br></strong> Your income will change when you move into independent living; it is worth getting to grips with budgeting now!  See slide for information on what you can expect to receive when you move out. <br></p>

            <p><strong>Social/family:<br></strong> It is important for you to make friends, socialise, perhaps join a gym or a club…..isolation and loneliness is a brutal factor of living independently and working on social links now can really help… <br></p>

            <p><strong>College/work:<br></strong> speak to your Social Worker to figure out what you want to do – make sure it is in your Pathway Plan and that you are working towards your goals. <br></p>

            <p><strong>Personal:<br></strong>It may be worth a visit to your GP, dentist and optician (if applicable) before you turn 18 – there may be some charges for services once you turn 18. <br></p>

            <p><strong>Merton will support you with:<br></strong> You must have a Pathway Plan <br>
              Up to the age of 18 years: you should see your Social Worker  a minimum of every 6 weeks.After the age of 18: Your personal advisor should see you a minimum of every 8 weeks. <br></p>
